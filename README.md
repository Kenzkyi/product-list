## Overview

This challenge was actually a fun . i personally took my time to make should it looks similar. Building a project like this isn't really easy but till not hard

- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"

## My process

so i started by structuring the ui, thats the user interface then i move to some functionality and with that i was able to complete the project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

trying to achieve the hover effect with out css 

```html
<h1 onMouseEnter={()=>setOnHover(true)}>Add to Cart</h1>
```

### Continued development

i will love to focused more on the semantics markup and also javascript syntax
